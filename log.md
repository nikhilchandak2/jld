R&D, Technical Support & Quality Control
Driving Innovation, Solving Challenges, Ensuring Consistency
At JLD Minerals, technical excellence is not just a promise ‚Äî it‚Äôs embedded in our DNA. Across Research & Development, Technical Support, and Quality Control, we are committed to delivering value-driven, future-ready, and application-specific ceramic solutions to clients around the globe.

üî¨ Research & Development
Innovating the Future of Ceramic Raw Materials

Our R&D division is one of the strongest in the ceramic raw material industry, powered by:

Two advanced R&D labs with state-of-the-art equipment

A highly qualified team of ceramic technologists and formulation experts

An extensive raw material base from our own mines ‚Äî giving us unparalleled flexibility in developing and testing new clay bodies and blends

With access to one of the widest local clay reserves in the country, our R&D can experiment, customize, and engineer high-performance materials that are not replicable elsewhere. This unique advantage allows us to develop specialty clays and mineral formulations that consistently outperform market standards.

We don‚Äôt just react to market needs ‚Äî we anticipate them. Our R&D pipeline is filled with forward-looking projects, targeting next-generation materials for faster firing, lower energy consumption, enhanced whiteness, and product differentiation.

At JLD, value creation for our clients is the core mission of R&D ‚Äî through cost-efficient, technically superior, and scalable engineered solutions.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Support
Solving Complex Challenges On-Site & At Scale

JLD Minerals leads the industry in real-time technical support, offering unmatched collaboration between our field technicians and in-house R&D team.

Our team:

Visits client factories regularly

Analyses operational challenges at the production line

Works hands-on with customers to tweak formulations, troubleshoot issues, and test solutions at scale

Helps customers increase productivity, improve output efficiency, and create innovative ceramic products

From improving yield to enhancing fired quality, and even helping customers reduce costs by millions of dollars, our technical support goes far beyond material supply ‚Äî it's a strategic advantage.

Our customers rely on us not just for material, but for partnership, process insight, and ceramic expertise that adds tangible value to their business.

üß™ Quality Control
Consistency from the Ground Up

Our quality control begins even before excavation starts.

Every raw material resource is:

Geographically surveyed and geo-chemically tested

Layer-mapped and segregated based on chemical and physical parameters

Sampled at multiple points during processing to ensure consistency

Before dispatch, materials are validated through a comprehensive suite of tests, including:

XRF chemical analysis

Loss on Ignition (LOI)

Moisture content measurement

Plasticity and shrinkage tests

Dry and fired strength tests

Fired whiteness and water absorption

Rheological behavior and casting rate analysis

Specific surface area and particle size distribution

Each dispatch is backed by batch-level traceability, documentation, and technical conformance, ensuring that our customers receive only the most reliable and consistent material ‚Äî every single time.
